'Classicfication Summary 

**Classification using KNN Algorithm with `MASS` and `class` libraries:**
    - Applied KNN algorithm to the `fgl` dataset.
    - Scaled the features and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - Demonstrated a classification example using the `gamlr` library and the `credit.csv` dataset.
    - Used sparse matrix representation for the design matrix.
    - Applied LASSO penalized multinomial regression using the `glmnet` package 

**Classification Example Metrics:**
    - Calculated various metrics such as min, AICc, AIC, and out-of-sample R^2 in classification example.
    - Investigated false positive and false negative rates.

**Extension: LASSO Penalized Multinomial Regression Example:**
    - Building from a suggestion from ChatGPT
    - Installed and loaded the `glmnet` package.
    - Created a sparse design matrix for the `fgl` dataset.
    - Performed cross-validated LASSO penalized multinomial regression.
    - Plotted the results and explored the coefficients and class probabilities.

#For the Extension I put the code that we had run in slides up to the extension due to mind blank I asked ChatGPT and asked how I could extend the provided cod, using ChatGPT I was able to come up with the extenstion as it help guide me on what to do for the extenstion.
