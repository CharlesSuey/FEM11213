Week 1 Chapter 1
In this week's code, I performed the following tasks:
   -Used web browser.CSV data.
   -Calculated the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the "spend" column using frequentist methods.
   -Used bootstrapping to estimate the sampling distribution of the mean.
   -Tried bootstrapping regressions with predictors "broadband" and "anychildren."
   -Made use of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) algorithm for controlling false discovery rate.
My Alteration/Extension
  For my extension, 
   -I ran a new linear regression model using the "spend" variable as the response
  -and "broadband" and "anychildren" as predictors. 
  -The summary of the model indicated that adding "anychildren" was not statistically significant.
